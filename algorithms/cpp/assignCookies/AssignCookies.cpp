/********************************************************************************** 
* 455. Assign Cookies [Easy]
* Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. 
* But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed 
* factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; 
* and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, 
* and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content 
* children and output the maximum number.

* Note:
* You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
* You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

* Example 1:
* Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]
* Output: 1
* Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
* And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child 
* whose greed factor is 1 content.
* You need to output 1.

* Example 2:
* Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

* Output: 2

* Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
* You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
* You need to output 2.
*
