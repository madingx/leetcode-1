/********************************************************************************** 
 * 636. Exclusive Time of Functions [Medium]
 * On a single threaded CPU, we execute some functions.  
 * Each function has a unique id between 0 and N-1.

 * We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.

 * Each log is a string with this format: "{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}".
 * For example, "0:start:3" means the function with id 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3.
 * "1:end:2" means the function with id 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2.

 * A function's exclusive time is the number of units of time spent in this function.  
 * Note that this does not include any recursive calls to child functions.

 * Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.
 * Example 1:
                  |fun1 start   ********************************  fun1 end|
    |fun0 start **---------------------------------------------------------**** fun0 end|
    0             1             2             3             4             5             6
 * Input:
 * n = 2
 * logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
 * Output: [3, 4]
 * Explanation:
 * Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
 * Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
 * Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 
 * So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
 

 * Note:
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
 * Functions will always log when they exit.
 *
